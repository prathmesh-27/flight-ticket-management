# flight-ticket-management
## Overview
This Java project, undertaken during an internship, focuses on the development of a web application. The project primarily utilizes Java for development, MySQL for database management, and Apache Tomcat version 9 for server-side deployment.

## Technology Stack

### Java
Java served as the primary development language for implementing both frontend and backend components of the web application. It was chosen for its versatility, robustness, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

### MySQL
MySQL was used as the backend database management system for persisting application data such as user profiles, transaction records, and configuration settings. It was selected for its reliability and efficiency in handling structured data.

### Apache Tomcat 9
Apache Tomcat version 9 provided the server environment for deploying the web application developed using Java technologies. It supports Java Server Pages (JSP), Java Servlets, and Java Expression Language (EL), facilitating dynamic web content execution.

## Project Execution Plan
The project execution plan outlined a structured approach for developing, implementing, and managing the internship project. Key components included:

- Requirement Analysis
- Design and Development
- Testing and Quality Assurance
- Deployment and Maintenance

## Guide to Run the Project

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Ensure that you have MySQL installed on your system.
   - Import the provided database file located in the folder into your MySQL database.

2. **Environment Setup:**
   - Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
   - Download and install Apache Tomcat version 9 from the official website.

3. **Project Configuration:**
   - Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

4. **Database Connection Configuration:**
   - Locate the database configuration file within the project.
   - Update the database connection settings (e.g., database URL, username, password) to match your MySQL configuration.

5. **Build and Deployment:**
   - Build the project to generate the WAR (Web Application Archive) file.
   - Deploy the WAR file to the Apache Tomcat server by copying it to the `webapps` directory of your Tomcat installation.

6. **Start the Server:**
   - Start the Apache Tomcat server by running the startup script (`startup.bat` for Windows or `startup.sh` for Unix/Linux) located in the `bin` directory of your Tomcat installation.

7. **Access the Application:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/{your_application_name}`.
   - You should now be able to access and interact with the web application.
